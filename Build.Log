Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade] Using backward-compatible build settings. The latest version of UE sets the following values by default, which may require code changes:
Warning: [Upgrade]     bLegacyParentIncludePaths = false               => Omits module parent folders from include paths to reduce compiler command line length. (Previously: true).
Warning: [Upgrade]     CppStandard = CppStandardVersion.Default        => Updates C++ Standard to C++20 (Previously: CppStandardVersion.Cpp17).
Warning: [Upgrade]     WindowsPlatform.bStrictConformanceMode = true   => Updates MSVC strict conformance mode to true (Previously: false).
Warning: [Upgrade]     bValidateFormatStrings = true                   => Enables compile-time validation of strings+args passed to UE_LOG. (Previously: false).
Warning: [Upgrade] Suppress this message by setting 'DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V5;' in FirstPersonGameEditor.Target.cs, and explicitly overriding settings that differ from the new defaults.
Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade]
Warning: [Upgrade] Using backward-compatible include order. The latest version of UE has changed the order of includes, which may require code changes. The current setting is:
Warning: [Upgrade]     IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Oldest
Warning: [Upgrade] Suppress this message by setting 'IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;' in FirstPersonGameEditor.Target.cs.
Warning: [Upgrade] Alternatively you can set this to 'EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest' to always use the latest include order. This will potentially cause compile errors when integrating new versions of the engine.
Warning: [Upgrade]
Total execution time: 1.04 seconds
FirstPersonGameEditor modifies the values of properties: [ bStrictConformanceMode ]. This is not allowed, as FirstPersonGameEditor has build products in common with UnrealEditor.
Remove the modified setting, change FirstPersonGameEditor to use a unique build environment by setting 'BuildEnvironment = TargetBuildEnvironment.Unique;' in the FirstPersonGameEditorTarget constructor, or set bOverrideBuildEnvironment = true to force this setting on.
